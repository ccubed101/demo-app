To perform the unit tests execute "demo-app-unit-tests.ps1" by right clicking the item and then selecting
"Run with PowerShell" in the context menu.

The "dockerfile" file is used to build the "demo-app-unit-tests:1.0.0" image.

NOTE: When the "demo-app-unit-tests:1.0.0" docker image is "run" it must be given 5 GB of memory.  That is
done using the following option for the "run" command: -m=5g.

The "demo-app-unit-tests.cmd" file is the batch file that is executed in the Docker container that is run
by the "demo-app-unit-tests.ps1" PowerShell script. 

The "docker-compose.yml" is a docker-compose file that was originally going to be used to "run" the
"demo-app-unit-tests:1.0.0" image.  But that method could not be used becasue the method of specifying 5 GB
of memory for running the container did not work.  (See the "docker-compose.yml" and "demo-app-unit-tests.ps1"
.files

The "unit-tests-output.txt" file contains the output of the Karma/Jasmine unit tests.
