Notes on demo-app
=================

Initial Setup Steps (2/7/2019)
------------------------------

>> Created the project using in Visual Studio Community 2017.  Selected "File/New/Project..." to display the
   "New Project" dialog.  In the dialog selected "Installed/Visual C#/Web/.NET Core" in the left panel and 
   then "ASP.NET Core Web Application" in the middle panel.  Pressed the "OK" button to display the "New 
   ASP.NET Core Web Application - <application name>" dialog.  In the dialog selected "ASP.NET Core 2.1" and
   the "Angular", no Docker support, no authentication and did check "Configure for HTTPS".

>> Ran the app from within Visual Studio.  The "node_modules" directory was created and the app ran.

>> As part of "restoring" he "node_modules" directory version 1.7.0 of the Angular CLI was installed.  Version
   6.0.1 of the Angular CLI had been previously installed globally.  Because the local version will be used 
   before the global version the local version had to be uninstalled using "npm uninstall @angular/cli"

>> The project created using the Visual Studio ASP.NET Core Angular template included version 5.2.0 of Angular.
   Decided to upgrade to the latest version of Angular.  But before doing so created a repository on GitHub 
   called "demo-app", turned the project directory hierarchy into a local repository using Git.exe and performed 
   an initial push so that the code, as provided by Visual Studio, would be saved.

>> Get the latest version of Angular, from version 5.2.0 to version 7.2.4 (except for @nguniversal/module-map-ngfactory-loader
   which was upgraded to version 7.1.0).

>> Modified the Configure() method in the Startup class in Startup.cs so that the Angular CLI server could
   be used.

>> 

>> Open a PowerShell window in "ClientApp" directory and types "npm serve".  Got an error message about a
   missing "angular.json" file.
